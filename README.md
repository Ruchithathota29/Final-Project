# SHA-256 Implementation (Book of Mark)

This program implements the **SHA-256 algorithm** from scratch in **C++** and uses **libcurl** to download the *Book of Mark* text automatically from a fixed URL:
https://quod.lib.umich.edu/cgi/r/rsv/rsv-idx?type=DIV1&byte=4697892



The program will:
- Download the Book of Mark text
- Compute its SHA-256 hash
- Display the hash in hexadecimal format

All SHA-256 logic is written manually using standard bitwise operations.
